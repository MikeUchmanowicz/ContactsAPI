## Introduction
I have created a Javascript web application (API) for this class. It is written in typescript using NodeJS and express as the backend and am currently using both Angular 
and React as a front-end. The api is a simple address book where contact information may be stored. Contact objects consist of an id, first name, last name, phone, email,
and a list of notes. A contact may have multiple notes. The application uses a MySQL database as its data store for these contacts and notes. 
Through the application, a user will be able to browse a list of contacts (and notes), create contacts (and notes), update contacts (and notes), and delete contacts 
(and notes). I would like to eventually add login and registration and per-user contacts, with each contact having an additional field: owner id. 
However, Iâ€™d like to leave this out of scope for now, as this also requires login and registration.
